                The brain is what it is because of the structural and functional
                properties of interconnected neurons. The mammalian brain
                contains between 100 million and 100 billion neurons, depending
                on the species. Each mammalian neuron consists of a cell body,
                dendrites, and an axon. The cell body contains the nucleus and
                cytoplasm. The axon extends from the cell body and often gives
                rise to many smaller branches before ending at nerve terminals.

                When neurons receive or send messages, they transmit electrical
                impulses along their axons, which can range in length from a
                tiny fraction of an inch (or centimeter) to three feet (about
                one meter) or more. Many axons are covered with a layered myelin
                sheath, which accelerates the transmission of electrical signals
                along the axon. This sheath is made by specialized cells called
                glia. In the brain, the glia that make the sheath are called
                oligodendrocytes, and in the peripheral nervous system, they are
                known as Schwann cells.
